Description: Record and generate a 'gif' of your 'R' sessions plots. When creating 
    a visualization, there is inevitably iteration and refinement that occurs. 
    Automatically save the plots made to a specified directory, previewing them 
    as they would be saved. Then combine all plots generated into a 'gif'
    to show the plot refinement over time.
